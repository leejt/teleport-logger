# OSRS Wiki Teleport Logger
This plugin makes it easier to log all of the teleports (and other large movements) that your character does, logging the start, end, and time taken.

To use this, enable it in the plugin hub, and then click the Transportation icon on the right nav bar. Doing a teleport should log it to the panel.
